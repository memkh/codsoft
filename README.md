Hi Everyone 👋 <br>
Madhav here from Delhi, Bharat.<br>
<img src="">
This is my github repo 📂 which I created with reference to my Codsoft Internship 🏢. In this internship , I had to complete 3 tasks listed below:- <br>
<br>
<strong>1. Landing Page</strong> : In this task , I cloned an awwwards website by a creative-design agency based in US , named as <em>Duo-studio</em>. I used multiple resources from youtube and google, to make this a reality. I had included multiple features like smooth scrolling, and scroll triggers to achieve this. I had also made a custom cursor which looks very nice. <storng>This website is only made for desktop screens and is not responsive as it is only made for big screens.</strong>
<br></br>
<strong>2. Portfolio</strong> : In this task , I had to create a portfolio website of myself including my skills , education, resume, projects and a short intro of me on the website. I had used HTML, CSS and Javascript Functions to make this portfolio website.
<br></br>
<strong>3. Calculator</strong> : In this task, I have to create a responsive calculator using HTML, CSS, Javascript. Through JS, I implemented the functionality of a Calculator like addition, subtraction, sign-change, multiplication , and modulo operations. And yes 😲 , this website is completely responsive and can work on all devices with width > 200px. Hope you all like it.
